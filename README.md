# NAS_HSLO
The code of NAS for paper "Heat Source Layout Optimization Using Automatic Deep Learning Surrogate and Multimodal Neighborhood Search Algorithm".

you can run mixpath_2.py to test the params and flops of the searched models.

train.py is the file to train the searched model architectures.

The data preparation can be referenced in "The heat source layout optimization using deep learning
surrogate modeling".
